    <h2>More About This</h2>
      <section id='More'>
        <p>Here are some more facts about drums:
          Types of drums
          There are many types of drums, including the snare drum, timpani, bass drum, and tom-toms. The most basic drum kit configuration has two tom-toms, one high and one low. 
          Drum shells
          Drum shells are made from different types of wood, which can affect the sound. For example, maple drums have a warm sound, while birch drums have a more aggressive sound. The number of wood layers, or plies, also affects the sound. Thinner plies make the drum more resonant. 
          Drumming as exercise
          Drumming can be a great form of exercise, burning more calories than cycling, hiking, or weight lifting in a half hour. It can also reduce stress hormones. 
          Drumming grips
          There are two main ways to hold drumsticks: the traditional grip and the matched grip. The traditional grip uses an overhand grip for the right hand and an underhand grip for the left. The matched grip has both sticks held the same way, with the palms facing down. </p>
